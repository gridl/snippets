## Cryptosplurge

Usage: `./splurge.py <file>`  

Cryptosplurge attempts to decrypt a file by attempting many common decryption
methods, and displaying the decrypted text to the user. By manually skimming
the decrypted data, the encryption method could be easily found.  

This is intended for use in CTF events or cyber challenges. Pushed for backup
purposes, currently only a basic idea.
